Mumble Gray skin
================

# About #

This is Mumble (http://mumble.info) skin created for those, that does
not like default white look of the application, because it can melt
your eyes in the middle of the night.

So I've decided to tweak my old skin, and ended up in creating a new
one, because 100% black is not always the best solution.

# Installation #
Easy, go to your Mumble configuration directory, there should be a
catalog named skins, go there, and clone this repo to it, in example
```
$ cd /home/kaszpir/Apps/Mumble/skins/
$ git clone https://github.com/nvtkaszpir/mumble-skin-gray.git
```
Then go to Mumble client, select Options > Configuration > Interface,
browse to the directory where you cloned the repo and select .qss
file that is in there. Make sure to select Plastique window style, and
then press OK.
